# Washington Fatal Crash Data Analyses

Team Members - Keshav Gupta, Soham Pawaskar, Gabriel Duran
The Washington Traffic Safety Commission has given us the opportunity to help them analyze the
Washington Fatal crash data, which includes the fatal crashes which took place in the past six years from
2017-2022. The data that they have provided is a comprehensive collection of fatal crashes.
The WTSC has given us the challenge of analyzing the proportion of drivers involved in these crashes
who live in the same location. By analyzing this, we learn if the people involved in the crash are residents
of that particular county or if they are traveling from another county. Using the longitude and latitude
coordinates given in the data, we applied reverse geocoding to see what counties and zip codes the fatal
crashes occurred in. Seeing the zip codes and counties helps us see who crashed in their own
communities.
The other challenge we are tackling is tracking the zipcodes which tend to produce the most high-risk
drivers. Using the data we collected from tackling the last challenge, we were able to find fifty high
accident prone zones. In addition, we have learned that in these top fifty zip codes, accidents are done
mostly by people living in their own community, and these areas are rural.
We are planning to incorporate additional hospital data into this given data, which will show us available
hospitals near high accident-prone zones and see if the hospital is capable enough to save drivers from
these fatal injuries.
